**This is my test code for the following description:**

I hope you're doing well. ðŸ˜Š First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to complete this technical test. The primary goal is to understand your coding style. This is one approach (at least, the one that came to mind) to gain some insight into that aspect. Please limit yourself to a maximum of ten hours; it is not meant to be time-consuming. The focus is on how you name variables, functions, classes, your clarity in understanding object-oriented programming, and your ability to refactor code. So, please avoid overthinking the process.

*Refactor Calendar.js to Object Oriented <br />
*Consider the single responsability of SOLID principles to make the refactor<br />
*The test has to pass (already pass in the code provided)<br />

**Just need to clone the repository and install the dependencies with the command "NPM INSTALL" on the console of your editor code. Then you can check the code with the command NPM TEST. Also, you can compare with the original example with the command NPM RUN TEST_ORIGIN.**
